This script can accept any arbitrary mathematical function that you would like to "hear" as a repeating waveform. Additionally, it can produce wavetables composed of the waveform altered by an arbitrary parameter "j" that is swept through to create each sample.

Input: A mathematical function for an arbitrary waveform and parameter(s) to sweep through 

Output: A wavetable of n waveforms, in .wav format. 32bit depth at 384kHz

Here is an example of a wavetable in Serum that was made with this script

Currently working on version 2, which will support multiple parameters to sweep through when generating the wavetable
